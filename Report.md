# Project Title

This project shows 20 news.

## Description
First, we need an API key to run this program. You should get it from this website: "https://NewsAPI.org".
Second, in the Infrastructure class, we retrieve the information, and the API returns data in JSON format.
Third, the part that I wrote is the News class, which converts JSON data into News objects.
At the end, the program displays 20 news articles, and the user can choose a number to get the full information about the selected news article.
